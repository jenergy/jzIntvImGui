game_name = Astrosmash - Meteor
description = https://history.blueskyrangers.com/mattelelectronics/games/astrosmash.html\n\nAstrosmash started out as Meteor!, a clone of the arcade game Asteroids. The game wasn't very big, so John Sohl used the extra room in the cartridge to come up with a variation called Avalanche! using the same graphics and sound effects. At the last minute, the Mattel lawyers killed the Asteroids-like Meteor!, afraid of a lawsuit from Atari. Rather than risk introducing bugs by deleting code, John simply put a branch around the opening-screen menu straight into the Avalanche! variation, which was released under the name Astrosmash.\n\nJohn admits he wasn't sorry to see Meteor! go -- he hadn't been happy with the game, much preferring the Avalanche! version.

game_name = Tron: Solar Sailer
description = https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3883\n\nTRON: Solar Sailer is a 1-player game with 2 stages of gameplay. In stage one, the player is given an access code to write down, and then is to guide the solar sailer down tracks in the computer world with the goal of reaching Track 0, where the MCP is located. As the player traverses the tracks, tanks attempt to shoot the sailer and recognizers attempted to move the sailer farther away from Track 0. I/O beams teleport the player closer to the MCP if they can properly enter the access code given to them at the beginning of the game. Moving down a track and shooting at enemies depletes energy from the track; switching tracks restores energy to full. If energy fully depletes before the player switches tracks, the sailer stops moving and the game is over. Energy levels can be monitored by the amount of "energy bugs" on the grid surrounding the track, with more bugs meaning more track energy. An audible warning also announces when track energy is low.

game_name = Adventure (AD&D - Cloudy Mountain)
description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/dndc.php\n\nIt seems obvious that the original intent was once again geared more toward simulating the gameplay of actual D&D rather than making an action game. It was initially listed as part of the Strategy Network. Since the Intellivision had been slammed for not having arcade action games, the gameplay was changed dramatically. If you look at it just right, it seems that INTV's Tower of Doom (intended to be a D&D title) took some graphical inspiration from the original concept. The game adopted the Cloudy Mountain moniker after the release of Treasure of Tarmin. The INTV Corp. catalogs referred to it as Cloudy Mountain (image courtesy of humblejack), though none of the Mattel ones ever did. In any case, the game play is pretty good, but firing arrows is a bit awkward, using the same system as Tron Deadly Discs. If you use two controllers, you won't have to stop to shoot arrows. It would have been nice to have multicolored sprites for the baddies, and better scaling. Still the graphics were decent - the map looked quite nice! The sound is functional, with some cool effects - but sparse. Played at the toughest speed, it's a hard game. The demons are especially difficult.

As far as I have seen, the screen scrolling between levels is unique to this game on the Intellivision. As a sequel to BurgerTime, it's wonderful. The soundtrack is just as catchy as BurgerTime's, and seems to be a natural - it preserves the feel. The graphics are pretty good, but I do wish the food balls had some more variety to them. Game play seems tougher than BurgerTime - it's difficult to tell if you can sneak around a baddie. The gameplay field is a 3-D environment (e.g. you can sneak behind baddies sometimes), and as an M.C. Escher-esque feel. This game is LOTS of fun!

As players explore the labyrinthine fortress they can collect treasures, magic scrolls, and healing items while battling Phantom Knights and Red Sorcerers. But they must be careful - if their adversaries catch them, they can lose half a life, and may need to be "reincarnated."

description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/dndt.php\n\nWithout a doubt, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin was an ambitious effort. In their first offering in the series of AD&D carts, Mattel produced an action-oriented adventure. Tarmin is more akin to an AD&D 'simulation'.\n\nYour goal is to recover the 'Treasure of Tarmin,' which is guarded by a fearsome minotaur. Along the way, you encounter various beasties that attack your body or your mind. Fortunately, you can also recover powerful weapons, armor, and magical items that will aid you in your quest.\n\nIf you are a D&D enthusiast - or especially if you were back then - then you will likely enjoy this game. Although it is not and action game, it is a good example of an early RPG - albeit one with a scant story to go with it. I spent many hours playing this game, mainly to try to recover as many of the cool magic items as possible. Getting the über magical books is a much more challenging quest than recovering the treasure!

game_name = Triple Action
description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/trac.php\n\nThree simple games, but fun. An analogue of Atari's Combat?\nWithout a doubt, if you're familiar with Intellivision history, you already have been indoctrinated that the Biplanes game in Triple Action is the reason to get this game. I agree. We played that almost exclusively. It's a blast! The other two games, a car racer and a tank battle, are OK.\nIn Biplanes, you duke it out with your opponent in a battle for supremacy in the skies. The graphics are simple, and control is a bit tough, but the physics are fun, and it's that that makes this game so fun. The various ways you can lose control of your plane, and the aerobatic maneuvers that you can accomplish make this cart worth owning.\nThe Racing Cars game is clearly the weakest game of this triad. You and your (optional) opponent simply race down a straightaway and dodge traffic. The graphics are probably the best of the three, but it is a dull game.\n\nOf course no system is complete without it's own version of Combat. In this case, it's called Battle Tanks, and it's a passable game. Perhaps I should be ashamed to admit it, but I've always rather liked Combat-type games, so I find this game enjoyable. Because it's faster paced than Armor Battle, it's perhaps better than that game from an action standpoint - but not in terms of strategy.

Your crop of corn is displayed on the left side of the screen, and you need to protect it from the incoming hoard of inchworms, moths, caterpillars, slugs, and other assorted bugs which approach rapidly from the right. If any of the bugs sneak past you, they will eat part of your corn crop. The game ends when all of the corn has been eaten. On each level you need to spray all of the bugs that appear in order to move on to the next round; as the rounds progress, the bugs become faster, more numerous, and home in quicker on the corn.

The voices are actually quite good, with the sexy female computer voice somewhat reminiscent of the original Star Trek TV series, the mechanical status report, and the sinister voice you hear at the end of the game. "The battle is over." Is it just me, or does that guy sound a bit like Yul Brynner?\nGameplay is much like any of the other Star Raiders clones out there, but perhaps it's a bit easier to control the ship's systems than the various third-party VCS clones (e.g. Activision's Starmaster and Imagic's Star Voyager). This game's overlay content is clearly much like the Atari VCS's Video Touch Pad controller overlay included with the Atari 2600 version of Star Raiders. You have full control over your ship's resources - Impulse Drive, Hyperdrive, Shields, Battle Computer, Tracking Computer, and Repair assignments. And, true to their word, Mattel made the voices essential to gameplay - don't bother trying to play without the Intellivoice unit.\n\nThe game is broken into two main screens - the star map strategy mode and the combat screen. The starmap is nicely done, but the combat screen is really not much more than a scrolling Space Battle screen with a fixed cursor and different aliens. They tried to have a 3-D look to the aliens, with them appearing small and growing larger - charging toward you, for example. The effect falls flat, mainly because you don't have a starfield effect, i.e. the stars are 'flat' and you don't seem to advance through them. The sound is adequate, the voices well-done. It's worth a good rousing play once in awhile, but it's definitely a middle-of-the-pack game in terms of long-term replay value.

You will need to take the form of a dolphin and a bird in order to locate the pieces that are hidden in the ocean and clouds. When flying in the air, there are several screens that have clouds flying by. Touch all of the clouds, and the trident piece appears! Other birds which are flying around will cause you to lose energy if you touch them accidentally. Underwater, trident pieces can be found by touching the sea horses. Octopuses, sharks, and a deadly maze of seaweed will get in your way and cause you to lose energy if caught!

You could say that it's not really technically much better than the Lock 'n' Chase or Bump 'n' Jump adaptations. The distinguishing factor, though, is that BurgerTime was also a hit in the arcades, unlike those others, and it had much better, more original game play than those games.I'm not sure just how many screens the arcade version had, but the Inty version has quite a few - at least five, I believe - perhaps more. The graphics are excellent - Peter Pepper is well rendered, as are the baddies. The sound is absolutely dead-on, with that catchy background loop music and superb sound effects. The animations are smooth and flicker-free. It's just flippin' awesome!

Not anything more than a random number generator with graphics and a couple other rules. Sure, you could argue the any of the card games are basically random number generator driven, but this doesn't even really hide that with a shifty-eyed dealer - and card games at least have an interesting number of variations in rules and strategies. Too bad the slots game wasn't included - it may have made the game more interesting (ooh, generate three random numbers!). Sadly, there is no Easter Egg to reveal Slots as a hidden game!

The second and third screens, Snake Lake and Rhino Ridge, aren't represented. The Lazy Lagoon is mostly intact, with the lily pads, hippos, giant fish, and charging rhino. Bongo is snoozing, and you can give him the hot foot when you reach the other side of the river. One unique aspect of this game is the scrolling between the Primate Peak and Lazy Lagoon screens.

I think Lock 'n' Chase deserves much praise. The graphics are crisp and clear, and the sound effects are beautiful! The little tune that plays when the money bag appears is excellent! Even the squick squawk of Lupin picking up the coins is well done. If it would have been possible, I'd have liked the coppers to be more colorful - but it appears that all of the extra moving objects were used on Lupin instead. Lock 'n' Chase is easily one of the best Pac-Man clones for Intellivision. I like it even better than the original!

But, this also seems to be one of the buggiest Intellivision games I've ever played.

Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it. Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to ten blows in each round. If all four cities are destroyed or the ship takes ten hits in a round, the game ends. Nova Blast is a single player game with three difficulty levels.

Even though everyone has this, it's still a fun game.\nHow can you not like Las Vegas Poker & Blackjack? The "shifty-eyed" dealer and the shuffling of the cards. We spent an unbelievable number of hours playing that game, seeing how low of a wallet we could start with and still build to 9999. It seems that the developer of this game must have skewed it in favor of the player, as the real thing is sure a lot harder. Of course, the dealer doesn't exactly play with a poker face...

Although the basic gameplay of the Word Hunt, Word Rockets and Crosswords games appears unchanged from the original Word Fun cartridge, the graphics were enhanced. According to the official site, a bug was introduced in the Crosswords game that resulted in the computer only choosing words starting with letters A-T instead of A-Z. The new game added to the mix is Memory Fun - your basic 'Memory' style game where you turn over pairs of tiles to find matches. Another grand edutainment game. No wonder they made so many. ;-)

It's got virtually everything you'd expect in Arkanoid - as well as a few things from Arkanoid 2.\nThe one element I've not located yet is an 'instant win' for the level, though that may be by design.\nAlthough there are not too many sound effects in this game, the sound effects are solid and precise.\nYou get the feeling that they are just ... right. The intro music and other snippets are executed quite well.\nJust how the heck are you supposed to control your 'ship'? Well, this problem has been solved most cleverly!\nThe 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions move your platform at 'normal' speed. The 2 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions move it faster, while the 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock positions provide\nmore detailed control at lower speeds. Each 'stage' in the game includes five 'levels'.\nAfter each stage, you gain a password, so that the next time you fire up Stonix, you can supply the password and jump immediately to that stage in the game. Similarly, when your game ends, you can immediately continue from the same stage in your next game.\nThe level design (by David Harley, Heather Harley & Arnauld Chevallier) has proven to be dead-on.

I can say the following things, though... The title screen music and graphics are great. Visit the official Intellivision Lives! site for an interesting history about the game's music. The graphics for the title screen and a couple other areas are also quite nice. The major disappointment with the graphics is the flickering of the balls. Since they were treated, apparently, as distinct objects (i.e. no dirty tricks were pulled), the limitation on the number of moving objects is exposed in this game.

The terrain maps are fun, and the graphics are nice and clean. It was the game that ushered in the Intellivision's infamous explosion sound effects and animations - which we all grew weary of over the years.

description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/maze.php\n\nAn interesting side-scroller puts you in the role of Flynn from the movie Tron.\n\nUnlike some other Intellivision review sites, I think Tron Maze-A-Tron is a solid game. It is an exploration side-scroller game - one of the earlier ones for the platform, I think. It's got a pretty good sized world, and it has a lot of really interesting elements. It's difficult, making it hard to reach the second phase of the game very often. But the sound effects are great and the various circuit components are well-done.\n\nAs the character Flynn from the Disney film Tron, you must navigate a dangerous and hostile electronic world and eventually confront the Master Control Program (MCP). Unlike the movie, and sticking to grand video game tradition (of the day), you cannot win, of course. It just keeps getting more and more difficult until you either die or quit. Still, I find the layout and graphics quite pleasing, the sound great, and the game overall interesting and unique enough to rate it well.

After all, those ships sure do look like Cylon Raiders! And at the time, Mattel seems to have had a license to sell Battlestar Galactica handheld games. This game was first published in the Action Network, but later made more difficult (ROM revised to speed up the game) and re-released in the Space Action Network, with the dark blue box. This is a fun, simple shooter. The original Intellivision box had a very different image of Space Battle. Seems you had to track fuel usage, and who knows what the other funky graphics are. Perhaps some of the ideas were reused in Space Spartans and Astrosmash?

Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.

Unlike other platforms offering voice expansions at the time (like the Odyssey2), Mattel's voice games actually required the voice unit to be playable. B17 Bomber is a solid game - and complex! Personally, I always enjoyed the completeness of the game - was it one of the earliest flight simulators? The flak from enemy fire has some 3-D effect to it, and the enemy fighters bank and break apart when hit. You bomb both land and sea targets, and you've got a plethora of gauges and information at your disposal. With several gunners, the bombardier, and main pilot views, you've got lots of activity to keep you busy. In addition, there are several distinct voices in the game, from the nervous navigator ("Fighters - 12 o'clock!") to the southern drawl of "Target in sight!", the voices are absolutely necessary for gameplay. It's fun to play in unlimited fuel mode, with 200 bombs, and just go on marathon missions sometimes.

A piece can split into two pieces during a turn (part of a number moves while the remainder stays put), and can meld into another piece yielding the sum of both numbers minus 1 (but can go no higher than 7). If a piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece whose number is equal or smaller, the opponent's piece is captured. If a piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece whose number is greater, that piece is sacrificed. The exception to the rule is that a 1 can reduce a 7 to a 6 (This move is called a 'dink.'). The object is to capture the opponent's castle. "There are fifty boards to choose from and custom boards can be built. All boards are symmetrical along a diagonal and can have an odd or even number of spaces vertically and horizontally, and can have no disjoint spaces. Zero, one, or two people can play. There is a second game known as Speed Strike that can only be played two-player. Speed Strike plays similarly to traditional Mind Strike except the two players do not take turns, and the castle is not captured immediately when a piece lands on it, but has an 'energy level' which decreases while it is occupied by an opposing piece (Think Space Spartans and the starbases.) and is destroyed when that energy level is fully depleted. "Both the green and white players are played by two AIs known as Max and Gus (if the computer plays one or both players). Max and Gus make moves using a two-pass routine. In the first pass, all legal moves are evaluated and all but the best moves are discarded. In the second pass, the few moves not discarded are carefully considered and are each assigned a value which is a summation of values assigned to factors pertaining to each move (Does it jeopardize the castle, will it capture an opposing piece, and so on). The beauty of this title is that the AIs can be 'reprogrammed' in a sense because the assigned values of each factor can be changed for each AI.

Your only hope is to use your supply of proton balls to try and destroy the field, one block at a time. Use your deflector to bounce proton balls against descending rows of energy layers. When a ball contacts the force field, it will neutralize that part of the barrier. But just when you think you're making some headway, more layers appear to seal you in. Just how much damage can you do to the force field before running out of proton balls? Features A one player action game. Blast your way through the mysterious force field.

It even took over as the pack-in game on the Intellivision II, displacing Lock 'n' Chase and Astrosmash. Sadly, it came at the beginning of the end. You could say that it's not really technically much better than the Lock 'n' Chase or Bump 'n' Jump adaptations. The distinguishing factor, though, is that BurgerTime was also a hit in the arcades, unlike those others, and it had much better, more original game play than those games.I'm not sure just how many screens the arcade version had, but the Inty version has quite a few - at least five, I believe - perhaps more. The graphics are excellent - Peter Pepper is well rendered, as are the baddies. The sound is absolutely dead-on, with that catchy background loop music and superb sound effects.

The sound effects for the score screen and finished energy base are great. In fact, I love all the sound effects. This is just a cool game, period! I'm not sure if I ever got to see the Prizums - this game gets tough! It's a strikingly original game, too.

It's another Pac-Man clone, with this game's gimmick being the rotating walls that change the shape of the maze. Although I'm not familiar with the arcade game, it is pleasing to see that they did a reasonably good job of preserving the prizes in each maze, and the graphics on them aren't too bad.

description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/pole.php\n\nWell, it tries to be Pole Position - it proved to be quite a technically challinging port for the Intellivision. It almost makes me a little more forgiving of Turbo. Almost. Pole Position is one of INTV Corp.'s rare misses. The graphics are OK, but the Intellivision controller just breaks down horribly for this kind of game. I have a horrible time playing this game - but at least it's better than Turbo. My hunch is that if I'd ever get good enough to qualify for more time, I'd see more graphics that looked nice. The sound is OK, but not incredible. As an arcade port, this one is tough to give high marks to mostly because of the extremely difficult control. Four different tracks are available to choose from - I can't recall how many there were in the original arcade version.

description = Prototype for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin Cartridge\n\nhttp://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/dndt.php\n\nWithout a doubt, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin was an ambitious effort. In their first offering in the series of AD&D carts, Mattel produced an action-oriented adventure. Tarmin is more akin to an AD&D 'simulation'.\n\nYour goal is to recover the 'Treasure of Tarmin,' which is guarded by a fearsome minotaur. Along the way, you encounter various beasties that attack your body or your mind. Fortunately, you can also recover powerful weapons, armor, and magical items that will aid you in your quest.\n\nIf you are a D&D enthusiast - or especially if you were back then - then you will likely enjoy this game. Although it is not and action game, it is a good example of an early RPG - albeit one with a scant story to go with it. I spent many hours playing this game, mainly to try to recover as many of the cool magic items as possible. Getting the über magical books is a much more challenging quest than recovering the treasure!

game_name = Beauty & the Beast
description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/beas.php\n\nIn Beauty & the Beast we find just how good Donkey Kong could have been on the Intellivision. In this variant, you are Buford, attempting to rescue Tiny Mabel from Horrible Hank. Borrowing an idea from Popeye, Mabel shows her love by casting hearts to you. Unlike Popeye, you don't need to collect these to move to the next level. Instead, they briefly make you invulnerable to the various obstacles you face. (OK, so they act like the hammer in DK.) Rats and birds and bats can knock you from the building, or falling boulders (courtesy of Hank) can crush you. Perhaps this is based later than Donkey Kong, because rather than scaling the skeletal girders on a construction site, you must climb up the open windows of a skyscraper to reach Mabel. As you advance, the building becomes narrower. Eventually, you reach the top and push Horrible Hank off the top of the building, experiencing a satisfying splat as he hits the ground. Of course, he's one mean cookie, and grabs Mabel again. Boulders move faster, split into two pieces, and can fall at angles and reverse direction, making your life miserable. The graphics are average for an Imagic game - making them above average for the Intellivision, and this is one of the few Imagic games with music in it. Probably the most famous feature of this game is the airplane that pulls a banner bearing a message to you after you complete each level of the skyscraper. Sometimes, it's encouraging (GREAT JOB!), other times a bit of a challenge to your gaming skills (LUCKY!). This is a really fun game.

This is followed by them beady-eyed, pitchfork totin' demons, three at a time.. This is a tough game, since the maze is continually changing, and there are different mazes on top of that.

You could say that it's not really technically much better than the Lock 'n' Chase or Bump 'n' Jump adaptations. The distinguishing factor, though, is that BurgerTime was also a hit in the arcades, unlike those others, and it had much better, more original game play than those games.I'm not sure just how many screens the arcade version had, but the Inty version has quite a few - at least five, I believe - perhaps more. The graphics are excellent - Peter Pepper is well rendered, as are the baddies. The sound is absolutely dead-on, with that catchy background loop music and superb sound effects.

Sure, it wasn't licensed to bear the Dungeons & Dragons title, but it's clearly meant to be a D&D game. The Blue Sky Rangers' site reports as much. Ironic that years later, there was an actual Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom arcade game by Capcom. The working title for this game at Mattel was Tower of Mystery. This iteration has arcade action combined with a wider variety of monsters, lots of cool magic items, as well as a multi-level dungeon like Treasure of Tarmin. Its visuals are more interesting than Tarmin's, but without the first person perspective. The real-time level map that's filled in as you explore is a great touch, as well as the close-up battle action, also in real-time, unlike Tarmin's turn-based combat.

description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/pinb.php\n\nNot content with action shoot-'em-ups, it seems all the old platforms (and even the modern PC) need at least one homage to the old steel sphere...\nWith its three-level playfield, colorful graphics, and tough challenge, Pinball will probably get quite a bit of gameplay. Provided you can get into simulated pinball. The physics are pretty good, and the game is tough, and the sound is sufficient. The main problem I have with it is that flipper action can be a little sluggish. I find that using the keypad rather than the side buttons makes the game a lot easier to play for extended periods.

Use your anti-marble shooter to crush this advancing threat! To eliminate marbles, create a sequence of 3 or more same coloured marbles either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Use your controller disk to move up and down in the playing field. You shoot your anti-marbles by pressing the right side of the disk. When things get really tough, toss a anti-marble bomb! The bomb will eliminate all zombie marbles of the same colour as the current anti-marble. Use them wisely! You only have three. You shoot your anti-marble bombs by pressing the left side of the disk. Game ends when the marbles advance to the end of the playing field.

description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/def.php\n\nWell-done port of the arcade game. Defender was a solid adaptation, and fun to play. My main beef is that the Smart Bomb is tied to the upper action key. This is just plain wrong. Everyone knows that your primary fire button is the top action key. The way I hold the controller, my index / trigger finger is on the top keys, and I use my middle or ring finger for the lower right button and thumb for the lower left. So, I usually end up burning up a smart bomb the first time I fire up the game after not playing in awhile.\nAlso note that the instruction manual mentions the ability to go into hyperspace, but fails to tell you how to do it. Just push any key on the keypad while not pushing on the disc.

game_name = Major League Baseball
description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/mlbb.php\n\nAhh, Major League Baseball. Probably the game that most identify as the quintessential Intellivision sports title. Recall George Plimpton's smirk in the (in)famous commercial that ridiculed the Atari VCS' pathetic little "baseball" game? Truly, though, Major League Baseball was a quantum leap forward in console sports games, along with the other initial Sports Network offerings. Even though it didn't have fly balls, and hits to the wall in the outfield were ground outs once you became a decent fielder (you could even bunt home runs!), it was an amazing game at the time. One of my favorite tricks is when you run the pitcher out to the outfield to retrieve a ball - the farther out, the better. Get the ball, and then "throw" the ball to yourself (the pitcher). Love that hyper speed running! The later World Championship Baseball is even better! Mattel Electronics must have loved baseball a lot. They made at least two hand-held baseball games. I still have my World Championship Baseball tabletop game, and should still have my original Baseball handheld somewhere. Additionally, they wrote three Intellivision baseball games! Initially we had the original Major League Baseball. Also developed, but not released by Mattel, was All Star Major League Baseball, which added 0- 1- or 2-player modes, fly balls, sliding into base, a slightly larger field of play, and tweaked sprites for the player animations. INTV Corporation released this game as World Championship baseball - one of the few games with which they included overlays. Finally, Mattel released World Series Major League Baseball for the Entertainment Computer System. I don't think any modern baseball game does not use elements that first existed in this game - panning across the field (even 3D!), players based on actual statistics from baseball history, "live" commentators via IntelliVoice, picture-in-picture showing men on base... Quite an impressive game for its day!

description = https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10166\n\nIn White Water! your goal is to raft down a river in the shortest time possible. The river features many dangerous turns, rocks, whirlpools, barrels, and other obstacles that get in your way. You begin your trip with three men, and if you don't navigate carefully they can fall out of the raft! If any men remain in the raft, they can try pick up anyone who has fallen out but must do so before they hit a rock, a whirlpool, or leave the screen (if all of your men fall out of the raft, the game will end). In the easier game variations, your score is based on how quickly you can reach the finish line. In the more difficult game variations, you not only need to reach the finish line as quickly as possible but also need to earn points by landing your raft at various beaches along the way and collecting treasures that can be found in the forest. Some of the treasures will be guarded by the natives, so be careful (also be sure not to wander too far into the forest, or you'll become lost). The game ends when you reach the finish line, or all your men are lost either by falling in the river or in the forest.

The title theme is one of the best little hooks I've ever heard in an Intellivision game, and if you check the Intellivision Lives! site, you can learn the fate of the composer of that nifty little ditty. The graphics of this game are cute, and the gameplay a lot of fun. Reminds me of Qix in many ways. The official site has quite a history of the origins of this game, as well as a slew of info about what happens when Marketing runs amok.

game_name = Advanced Dungeons and Dragons - Cloudy Mountain
description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/dndc.php\n\nIt seems obvious that the original intent was once again geared more toward simulating the gameplay of actual D&D rather than making an action game. It was initially listed as part of the Strategy Network. Since the Intellivision had been slammed for not having arcade action games, the gameplay was changed dramatically. If you look at it just right, it seems that INTV's Tower of Doom (intended to be a D&D title) took some graphical inspiration from the original concept. The game adopted the Cloudy Mountain moniker after the release of Treasure of Tarmin. The INTV Corp. catalogs referred to it as Cloudy Mountain (image courtesy of humblejack), though none of the Mattel ones ever did. In any case, the game play is pretty good, but firing arrows is a bit awkward, using the same system as Tron Deadly Discs. If you use two controllers, you won't have to stop to shoot arrows. It would have been nice to have multicolored sprites for the baddies, and better scaling. Still the graphics were decent - the map looked quite nice! The sound is functional, with some cool effects - but sparse. Played at the toughest speed, it's a hard game. The demons are especially difficult.

description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/sbat.php\n\nYou shouldn't even have an Intellivision if you don't have Space Battle. One of the core games of the system. When you initially encounter combat in Space Battle, you must wonder if the bad guys are the Cylon Raiders from Battlestar Galactica. After all, those ships sure do look like Cylon Raiders! And at the time, Mattel seems to have had a license to sell Battlestar Galactica handheld games. This game was first published in the Action Network, but later made more difficult (ROM revised to speed up the game) and re-released in the Space Action Network, with the dark blue box. This is a fun, simple shooter. The original Intellivision box had a very different image of Space Battle. Seems you had to track fuel usage, and who knows what the other funky graphics are. Perhaps some of the ideas were reused in Space Spartans and Astrosmash?

game_name = Buzz Bombers
description = http://www.intvfunhouse.com/games/buzz.php\n\nQuite a challenging game - with intermissions!\nBuzz Bombers is Mattel's variation on the Centipede theme, wherein you battle bees in your garden. It seems to me you'd want bees pollinating the flowers in your garden... In any case, when you kill a bee with a shot of spray from your spray can, it creates a honeycomb, which acts as an obstacle like the mushrooms in Centipede. The unique aspects are that if a bee gets trapped, it creates a beehive, and there is a hummingbird that eats the honeycombs and the beehives, giving you bonus points. The hummingbird becomes more of nuisance than anything else, as it tends to eat the honeycombs that are most helpful to you. The sound is pretty nice, using "The Flight of the Bumblebee" as the soundtrack. Turns out this game pushes your RF modulator pretty hard - many old Intellivision units exhibit interference when firing a shot from the spray can. The graphics are nice enough, and there are several intermissions.\nThe key to this game is to build up a nice bee-trapping layout, as when a bee builds a hive, you don't need to shoot it. Your spray can is limited to a small number of sprays - use it up, and you're down one turn. Also, if your garden hems you in, you lose a spray can. The Intellivision Lives site reports that Mattel attempted to market the game to the makers of Raid insecticides, but they declined the tie-in. Imagine that!

Faced with a dearth of 1-player games, and no high-profile arcade game licenses, this was the big splash for Mattel's efforts to produce arcade-style games for the Intellivision. Actually, this was quite a departure from the standard game fodder of the day - mostly 2-player sports games or 2-player strategy / military games like Sea Battle or Armor Battle. Another interesting facet of this game is that it gets easier as you do worse in the game
