Notes for jzintv on OS X
May 28, 2005 John Tanner

Build notes:
Must use a SDLMain.o new enough to be able to use CPS_* functions.
These functions, in part, enable the program to hear keystrokes entered 
into the main window.

Usage notes:
When running jzintv in a window, F10 and F11 are unavailable due to Exposé. 
Remap these keys or run the program in full screen mode.

Accelerator keys, such as Cmd-Q, etc. do not work with this version of
jzintv. They are available in the GUI version.
